Greetings, program!

I am a composer, not a coder. Some of my compositions form complete English sentences. 

Many of those compositions describe user interfaces to software I would like to exist.

    Here is one such interface:

001   User searches for song title, i.e. "Metallica Sanitarium" on youtube...

002   list of uploaded files that match the search are displayed...

    So far, so good...
    
The add-on I envision scans the audio data for each file in the list,
and displays a graphical visual cue for each list item based on the amplitude 
(volume) and fidelity (frequency) of the file that allows the user to 
select the file with prefered sound quality.

Sometimes high quality is prefered, sometimes any sound quality is acceptable.
This filter makes the distinction possible.

The interface takes the form of "bars" and a "plus, minus" sign after the bars.

There are three consecutive bars, similar to a phone rec3eption interface -- small, medium, and large

    small:  the audio is faint
    medium: the audio is robust
    large:  the audio is loud!
    
There is a '+' or a '-' sign proceeding the bars, indicating audio file resolution

    +       the audio is high quality
    -       the audio is not so high quality
    
Is such a plug-in/ add-on cost effective to produce? 

I have many other compositions awaiting refinement and implementation. Seeking partnership with compatible coder.
